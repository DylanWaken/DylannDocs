# THE DYLANN PROJECT

----

## What is Dylann?

The Dynamic Lightweight Framework for Algorithmic Neural Networks (Dy.L.A.N.N) is for designing and training neural nets in C++ and CUDA environment. The project is intended to be
highly modular and easy to use, especially for the application in game engines or other non-python contexts
that seeks direct access to nn models. The project is still in its early stages, but the core architecture
is basically shaped and ready for applications. 

For now, Dylann is only accessable through CUDA C as a runtime application. When the basic instruction sets are completed 
the base code would be compiled into libraries that can be linked in other projects. Dylann will not be including external
libraries else than CUDA stl, OpenCV (and audio libraries in the future).
